## üìä Project Overview

- **Goal:** Classify crop seedlings and weed species from image data to support precision agriculture.
- **Dataset:** 12 species of seedlings provided in separate training and testing directories.
- **Approach:**
  - A lightweight **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was trained on the dataset for feature extraction.
  - Extracted feature vectors (size `256`) were used to train:
    - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with a linear kernel.
    - **XGBoost** with tuned hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, weighted F1-score, and micro-average ROC-AUC.
