# CNN + SVM + XGBoost Hybrid for Agricultural Seedling Classification ðŸŒ±
Convolutional Neural Network and Hybrid Models for Agricultural Seedling Classification

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for **CNN-based deep feature extraction combined with traditional machine learning classifiers (SVM and XGBoost)** to classify plant seedlings into **12 species**.  
The project was developed as part of the **COS801 Introduction to Deep Learning** coursework.
